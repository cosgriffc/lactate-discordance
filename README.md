The goal of this work is to build a predictive model for lactate-phenotype discordance. This is ongoing work
and some of the files are subject to change. The portion of this project written up to 5/2018 represents my
practcium work for the completion of a Masters of Public Health in Quantitiave Methods at Harvard Chan School.

This repository is organized as follows:
* Extraction: contains a notebook and requisite scripts for extacting cohort data from the eICU database
* EDA: contains a notebook with an exploratory analysis of the cohort as well as a notebook examining the
association between lactate discordance and mortality. (_Note on mortality: As this was examined after the initial extract, this
file performs a database pull to attain mortality status._)
* Classifier: contains a notebook which documents the construction of a classifier
