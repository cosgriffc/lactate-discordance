# Predictive Modeling of Lactate-Phenotype Discordance
## C.V. Cosgriff, MIT Critical Data

The goal of this preliminary work is to build a predictive model for lactate-phenotype discordance. This repository is organized as follows:
* Extraction: contains a notebook and requisite scripts for extacting cohort data from the eICU database
* EDA: contains a notebook with an exploratory analysis of the cohort
* Classifier: contains a notebook which documents the construction of a classifier

This version of the work represents my Harvard Chan School practcum project. Future work will examine class imbalance issues as well seek to understand
some of the assoiciations found between diagnosis and lactate discordance.
