The goal of this preliminary work is to build a predictive model for lactate-phenotype discordance. This repository is organized as follows:
* Extraction: contains a notebook and requisite scripts for extacting cohort data from the eICU database
* EDA: contains a notebook with an exploratory analysis of the cohort
* Classifier: contains a notebook which documents the construction of a classifier

This version of the work represents my Harvard Chan School practcum project.
